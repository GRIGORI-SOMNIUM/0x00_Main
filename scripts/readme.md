Basically this is a collection of random scripts that are useful for various purposes.
I make no promises to their efficacy or if they even work.
Most have specific requirements that I may break out into specific projects and better explain.
Or maybe not...




///////// Triage.ps1
- This script is super buggy but it is meant to faciliate forensic collection on a Windows system (i.e. Windows 10).
- It does expect binaries to be in the ./src/ directory. Plan accordingly prior to running.
- Test software and script prior to using in a live enviorment (duh)
